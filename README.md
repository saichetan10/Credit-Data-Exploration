# Credit EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)  

## Overview  
This project focuses on performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a credit dataset to uncover trends, correlations, and insights. By analyzing credit-related data, we aim to better understand key factors that influence credit behavior, risk, and performance.  

## Features  
- Detailed analysis of credit data to identify patterns and trends.  
- Visualization of key metrics to gain deeper insights.  
- Statistical analysis of relationships between various features.  
- Identification of correlations and outliers to enhance data understanding.  

## Technologies Used  
- **Programming Language**: Python  
- **Libraries/Tools**:  
  - `pandas` and `numpy` for data manipulation.  
  - `matplotlib` and `seaborn` for data visualization.  
  - `scipy` and `statsmodels` for statistical analysis.
